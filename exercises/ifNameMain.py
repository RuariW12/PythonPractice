# if __name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
#       Functions and classes in this module can be reused
#       without the main block of code executing
#       Good practice (cose is modular, helps readability, leaves no global variables, avoid unintended exec)


# ex. library = import library for functionality
#       when running library directly, display a help page

# "Run this part only if this file is being run directly, not if itâ€™s being used somewhere else."
